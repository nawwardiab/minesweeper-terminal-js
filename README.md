# Minesweeper

Welcome to Minesweeper, a classic game where you uncover tiles on a grid, trying to avoid hidden mines. The game ends when you uncover all non-mine cells or hit a mine.

## Project Overview

In Minesweeper, the game involves:

- **Board Representation:** A grid (customizable size) where some cells contain hidden mines, and others are safe.
- **Mine Placement:** Mines are randomly placed on the board, making each game unique.
- **Uncovering Cells:** Players can choose to uncover a cell. If the cell is safe, it shows the number of adjacent mines. If it contains a mine, the game ends.
- **Flagging Cells:** Players can flag cells they suspect contain mines to avoid accidentally uncovering them.
- **Move Validation:** Ensures players select valid coordinates within the grid.
- **Winning Condition:** Players win if they successfully uncover all non-mine cells.
- **Losing Condition:** The game ends when a mine is uncovered.
- **Restart Option:** After a game concludes, players can choose to restart or quit.
